# Failed ChatGPT classifier

## In this folder you find the training and evaluation notebooks of the chat GPT model instances which yielded non-usable results. 

A likely reason why their performance is so bad is because these models are genertive models and we did not change their architecture. Therefore these models serve as a reminder to us that models should be used according to their designed use case scenario. 

The [final chat GPT2 model](../chat3GPT-classifier.ipynb) that is used as a benchmark in our report has an architecture which is geared towards classification problems.
